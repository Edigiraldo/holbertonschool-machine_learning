    Function that creates and trains a genism fastText model.

    - sentences is a list of sentences to be trained on.
    - size is the dimensionality of the embedding layer.
    - min_count is the minimum number of occurrences of a word
      for use in training.
    - window is the maximum distance between the current and
      predicted word within a sentence.
    - negative is the size of negative sampling.
    - cbow is a boolean to determine the training type;
      True is for CBOW; False is for Skip-gram.
    - iterations is the number of iterations to train over.
    - seed is the seed for the random number generator.
    - workers is the number of worker threads to train the model.

    Returns: the trained model.
