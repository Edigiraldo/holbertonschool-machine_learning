    Function 

    - X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) containing the data set.
    - kmin is a positive integer containing the minimum number of
      clusters to check for (inclusive).
    - kmax is a positive integer containing the maximum number of
      clusters to check for (inclusive).
    - If kmax is None, kmax should be set to the maximum number of
      clusters possible.
    - iterations is a positive integer containing the maximum number
      of iterations for the EM algorithm.
    - tol is a non-negative float containing the tolerance for the
      EM algorithm.
    - verbose is a boolean that determines if the EM algorithm should
      print information to the standard output.

    Returns: best_k, best_result, l, b, or None, None, None, None
    on failure
        - best_k is the best value for k based on its BIC.
        - best_result is tuple containing pi, m, S.
            - pi is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k,) containing the
              cluster priors for the best number of clusters.
            - m is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d) containing the
              centroid means for the best number of clusters.
            - S is a numpy.ndarray of shape (k, d, d) containing
              the covariance matrices for the best number of clusters.
    - l is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kmax - kmin + 1) containing the
      log likelihood for each cluster size tested.
    - b is a numpy.ndarray of shape (kmax - kmin + 1) containing the
      BIC value for each cluster size tested.
        - Use: BIC = p * ln(n) - 2 * l.
        - p is the number of parameters required for the model.
        - n is the number of data points used to create the model.
        - l is the log likelihood of the model.
